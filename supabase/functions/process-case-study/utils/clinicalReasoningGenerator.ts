I don't have access to the original content of `clinicalReasoningGenerator.ts` in your codebase, so I cannot reconstruct the full file by replacing the `// ... keep existing code` comment. The AI's response only showed the imports that needed to be updated, but didn't show the rest of the file's content.

To help you properly, I would need to see the current content of `supabase/functions/process-case-study/utils/clinicalReasoningGenerator.ts`. Could you share that file's content?
