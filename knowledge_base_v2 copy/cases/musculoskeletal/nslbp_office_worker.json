The next day I could barely move. My GP gave me ibuprofen and told me to rest. It got a bit better after a week, but now it's stuck at this level. I've been worried because my father had a disc herniation and needed surgery. I've stopped playing tennis and I'm scared to pick up my kids. At work, I can barely concentrate because of the pain after sitting for a while. My wife has to do more around the house and I feel guilty about that.",
