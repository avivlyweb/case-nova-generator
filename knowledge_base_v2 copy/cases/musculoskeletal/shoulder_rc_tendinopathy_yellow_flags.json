    "patient_narrative": "It started about 9 weeks ago — I can't point to one moment. I just noticed it was getting harder to reach the whiteboard and the supply shelves in my classroom. I'm right-handed, so I can't really avoid using it. My GP told me to take paracetamol and rest it, but how can I rest it when I'm teaching 25 eight-year-olds all day? The pain is getting worse, not better. I'm worried because my mother had a frozen shoulder that took over a year to improve and she never fully recovered. I've stopped swimming — it's too painful. I can barely keep up with lesson preparation because writing on the board hurts so much. I feel like I'm letting my students down. Honestly, I'm already dealing with a lot — the divorce was two years ago but I'm still adjusting to living alone, and work has been stressful with a new school director pushing for higher test scores. I just don't feel like myself anymore. I keep thinking: what if this doesn't get better? What if I can't teach anymore?",
