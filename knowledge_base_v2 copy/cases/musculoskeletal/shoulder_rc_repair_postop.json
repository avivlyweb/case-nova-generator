I can't even carry my own coffee cup with my right hand because of the sling. The pain isn't too bad actually — it's mainly sore at night when I roll over. The surgeon said it would take about 6 months before I can do my DIY work again. That's a long time. My neighbor asked me to help fix his garden fence next month and I had to say no. I just hope this surgery works — I tried physiotherapy before and it helped a bit but the shoulder never got properly strong again.

However, short-term post-operative use is clinically appropriate.
