    "patient_narrative": "Willem van der Berg is 58 years old, a high school history teacher in Utrecht. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 3 months ago after 2 years of symptoms he initially attributed to 'getting older' - a slight tremor in his right hand, difficulty with fine movements, and feeling 'slowed down.' His wife Ans noticed changes in his handwriting and facial expression before he did. Willem is still working full-time but finding it increasingly tiring. He's started on levodopa/carbidopa and has noticed some improvement. Willem is clearly intelligent and has read extensively about PD. He asks detailed questions and seems to be processing the diagnosis intellectually rather than emotionally. He says, 'I'm a historian. I know that nothing stays the same. I just need to understand what's coming so I can prepare.'",

        "teaching_answer": "Prevention and Cure. Prevention of deconditioning, falls, and secondary complications. 'Cure' in PD means optimizing function and slowing functional decline - exercise is disease-modifying in PD. Early intensive exercise may modify disease progression. This is a crucial intervention window."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What is the evidence for exercise in early Parkinson's disease?",
        "teaching_answer": "Strong evidence: (1) Intensive exercise may have disease-modifying effects (neuroprotection), (2) Aerobic exercise improves motor symptoms, cognition, and mood, (3) Nordic walking shown effective, (4) Boxing/LSVT BIG improves amplitude, (5) Tai chi improves balance. Key message: early high-intensity exercise is recommended. Willem is at optimal stage for intensive intervention."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Willem is intellectualizing his diagnosis. Is this a concern?",
        "teaching_answer": "Intellectual coping can be protective initially but may mask emotional processing. Watch for: (1) Depression developing later, (2) Anxiety about the future, (3) Impact on relationship with Ans. HADS-A of 9 suggests borderline anxiety. Current approach: (1) Provide information (he needs this), (2) Gently explore emotions, (3) Monitor over time, (4) Consider referral to PD nurse or psychologist if needed."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How do you counsel Willem about prognosis without causing distress?",
        "teaching_answer": "Honest but hopeful approach: (1) PD is variable - impossible to predict individual trajectory, (2) New treatments are extending quality of life, (3) Exercise is proven to help, (4) Many people live well with PD for decades, (5) Focus on what he can control (exercise, medication adherence, lifestyle). Don't give false hope but don't catastrophize. Willem wants information - provide it in digestible amounts."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Design an exercise program for Willem at this stage.",
        "teaching_answer": "Early-stage PD program: (1) Aerobic: cycling (he likes it) or Nordic walking, 30-40 min 3x/week, moderate-vigorous intensity; (2) Amplitude training: large movements, LSVT BIG principles, maintain movement size; (3) Balance: progressive balance training, dual-task practice; (4) Flexibility: stretching for rigidity, trunk rotation; (5) Consider group class (PD-specific boxing, dance, tai chi) for social support and fun. Key: make it intensive and enjoyable so he'll maintain it."

Most concerning are episodes of freezing of gait (FOG), particularly when going through doorways or when stressed. He's fallen twice in the past month. His medication regimen is complex. Ans (now 66) retired early to care for Willem. She attends every appointment with a notebook full of observations. Willem seems frustrated - 'I was the teacher. Now I need to be taught how to walk. It's humiliating.' Ans quietly says, 'He's not the only one affected by this disease.'",

Treatment strategies: (1) External cueing - visual lines/laser, auditory metronome/rhythmic cues, (2) Attentional strategies - 'think about walking,' break down automatic pattern, (3) Avoid triggers when possible, (4) Action observation and motor imagery, (5) Cognitive training for dual-task performance, (6) Consider cueing devices (laser cane, metronome apps).

Ans (now 73) has taken over almost all decision-making. She looks exhausted but refuses help. They've moved to a ground-floor apartment in a senior living community. Son Pieter has moved back to Utrecht and is actively involved. Emma visits from London several times a year. Willem says little during the assessment - Ans answers most questions.

His cognition has declined further. He has periods of clarity but also agitation and confusion. Ans visits daily, often just sitting and holding his hand. She struggled with guilt about the nursing home admission but is slowly accepting it. Pieter and Emma (who moved back from London) visit regularly. The nursing home team has discussed that Willem is in the palliative phase. He has previously expressed he would not want prolonged life with severe disability - Ans is his legal representative for medical decisions.
