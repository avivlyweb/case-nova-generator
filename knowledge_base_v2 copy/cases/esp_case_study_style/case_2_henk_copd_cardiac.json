Henk is a large man, clearly physically strong from years of manual work. He seems uncomfortable in the clinic setting and keeps saying 'I'm sure it's nothing, just need to get it sorted.' He mentions he's had a 'bit of a cough' for a while but attributes it to 'a cold that won't go away.' You notice nicotine stains on his fingers.",

Actions: (1) Assess Joke's wellbeing explicitly, (2) Educate family on sustainable caregiving, (3) Involve home care services, (4) Discuss respite options, (5) Include Kees in care routines, (6) Recognize Joke is a patient too. If caregiver collapses, patient's home care collapses."

Physiotherapy approach: (1) Focus on quality of life, not quantity, (2) Respect his wishes, (3) Communicate with GP and palliative team, (4) Discuss what 'good days' look like and optimize for those, (5) Support him to maintain dignity and control. This is part of compassionate care."

(3) Age 68: Optimal dual cardiac-pulmonary rehab. Each decade, opportunities existed. The most impactful would have been smoking cessation at 48 - would likely have prevented COPD progression and significantly reduced cardiac risk. This case illustrates primary prevention importance."
