Some functional improvement is possible (frailty is partially reversible) but expectations should be realistic."

Extrinsic factors: home hazards (rugs, bathroom, lighting), incorrect walker use. Behavioral: staying in chair all day (ironic 'protection' that worsens weakness)."

She is now at higher fall risk BECAUSE of avoidance. Breaking this cycle requires graded activity, building strength, and addressing fear cognitively."

Pieter is a patient too - should not be expected to do everything."

        "question": "What is your intervention plan?",
