It illustrates the shifting priorities from motor development and preventing deformity in childhood, to participation and independence in adolescence, to self-determination and 'living with' CP in adulthood. The case highlights the critical transition from pediatric to adult services and the reality that CP is a lifelong condition requiring evolving support."

    "patient_narrative": "Bram Jansen is 8 years old and has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (GMFCS Level II). He was born prematurely at 28 weeks and diagnosed with CP at 18 months. He attends a mainstream primary school (basisschool) in Rotterdam with some support. Bram walks independently but has a characteristic scissoring gait and has difficulty keeping up with his peers in the schoolyard. He uses a posterior walker for longer distances and has a wheelchair for family outings. Bram is a bright, cheerful boy who loves dinosaurs and playing Minecraft. His parents, Marco (38, IT consultant) and Sophie (36, part-time office manager), are actively involved in his care. They're anxious about his transition to secondary school (middelbare school) in a few years. 'Will he cope? Will he be bullied? Should we look at special education?' Bram himself seems less worried. When asked what he wants, he says, 'I want to play football with my friends, but they're too fast.'",

        "teaching_answer": "Prevention and Cure. Prevention of secondary musculoskeletal problems (contractures, hip displacement, crouch gait progression). 'Cure' through optimizing function - at age 8 with GMFCS II, there is still potential for motor gains. Participation is already important but will become central focus as he ages."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Explain the significance of GMFCS Level II and what it predicts about Bram's future function.",
        "teaching_answer": "GMFCS Level II: Walks independently, limitations outdoors/community, may use wheeled mobility for long distances, can use handrails for stairs. Prediction: GMFCS is stable after age 6 for most children. Bram will likely remain Level II but may function at the lower end without intervention. Risk: crouch gait can worsen in adolescence if not managed. Strength, flexibility, and fitness are modifiable factors."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Bram's parents are worried about mainstream secondary school. How do you address this?",
        "teaching_answer": "Approach: (1) Validate concerns - transition is challenging, (2) Focus on preparation rather than changing schools, (3) Discuss what he needs - physical access, fatigue management, peer relationships, (4) Many GMFCS II children succeed in mainstream with support, (5) Introduce gradual independence now (carrying own bag, managing breaks), (6) Connect with families who've navigated this, (7) Occupational therapy for school function. Inclusion is best supported by preparation, not avoidance."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Bram says he wants to 'play football but they're too fast.' How do you use this goal therapeutically?",
        "teaching_answer": "Using child's goals: (1) This is a COPM goal - meaningful to him, (2) Analyze the activity - football requires speed, agility, endurance, ball skills, (3) Modify the goal - maybe not competitive football but he could play goalkeeper, join CP football, or play adapted games, (4) Train component skills - endurance, speed, ball control, (5) Introduce alternatives - boccia, wheelchair basketball, frame football, (6) Social aspect is key - he wants to play WITH friends. Therapy goals should include participation in play, not just motor skills."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What surveillance is needed for a child with GMFCS II CP?",
        "teaching_answer": "CP surveillance (Dutch CPNET guidelines): (1) Hip surveillance - X-rays every 1-2 years until hip stable (risk of displacement), (2) Spine monitoring - scoliosis watch, (3) ROM monitoring - identify contracture early, (4) GMFM tracking - monitor for functional decline, (5) Nutrition and growth, (6) Communication and learning, (7) Vision and hearing. Early intervention prevents surgery/deterioration."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Design a physiotherapy program for Bram at this stage.",
        "teaching_answer": "PT program for 8-year-old GMFCS II: (1) Stretching - gastrocnemius, hamstrings, hip flexors (daily home program with parents), (2) Strengthening - functional lower limb strength, especially extensors (step-ups, sit-to-stand games), (3) Gait training - cueing for knee extension, reducing crouch, (4) Fitness - cycling (adapted if needed), swimming, active games, (5) Motor learning - bike riding if possible, ball skills, (6) AFO optimization - review with orthotist. Make it fun - games-based approach. Involve parents in home program."

Bram himself seems withdrawn. When you ask how school is going, he shrugs. Eventually he says, 'I'm sick of being different. I don't want people to see me with a walker. I just want to be normal.' He's stopped doing his stretches, refuses to wear AFOs at school, and has dropped out of CP football - 'too babyish.' He's interested in computers and gaming. Physically, he's developed more crouch in his gait, has lost some of the ROM he had at 8, and his endurance is reduced.",

(2) Explore - what does 'normal' mean to him? What specifically does he want? (3) Gently reframe - 'normal' is a myth; everyone has challenges, (4) Focus on function not appearance - what does he want to DO?, (5) Connect with positive disability identity - other successful adults with CP, role models, (6) May benefit from psychology/peer support.

Different equipment?, (4) Explain consequences without lecturing - 'If you don't stretch, this is what might happen,' (5) Negotiate - minimum necessary, (6) Accept he may choose function loss to gain social acceptance - that's his right. Transition to self-management means accepting his choices."

Don't dismiss his interests as 'sedentary' - they're his identity and future."
